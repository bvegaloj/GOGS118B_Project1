# GOGS118B_Project1

The purpose of this project wasâ€¯to make sense of the data by using unsupervised methods by evaluating the efficiency of Maximum Likelihood estimation, K-means, and Expectation-Maximation (EM) algorithms on mixture and multivariate Bernoulli distributions. The data set for this experiment was the MINST Data set, a compilation of handwritten digits in which each image is composed of a 28x28 matrix of pixels. Each algorithm is performed individually into three different sections.
